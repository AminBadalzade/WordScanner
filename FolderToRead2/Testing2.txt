The sea was calm that evening, stretching endlessly toward the horizon like a sheet of glass. Captain Mireille stood at the helm of her ship, The Northern Gale, eyes scanning the golden shimmer where the sun dipped into the waves. Her crew moved quietly, respectful of the silence that always followed the end of a long voyage. They had been at sea for ninety-three days, chasing whispers of an island that no map dared mark.

Legends spoke of a place where time stood still, where storms could not reach, and where the stars aligned in perfect circles. Most believed it was nothing more than a sailor’s myth, a tale told to children to lull them to sleep. But Mireille had seen a fragment of truth. Years ago, she’d found an old journal bound in seaweed and inked with salt—its pages filled with coordinates and sketches of strange symbols no known language could explain.

Tonight, those coordinates pointed here. And although no land was visible, the compass needle trembled violently, spinning even in still air. Below deck, the crew's voices hushed as the temperature dropped. The lanterns flickered blue. Mireille gripped the railing tightly, not from fear—but readiness.

Whatever waited beneath the surface, or beyond the mist now rising from the east, she would face it. Not just as a captain, but as a seeker of the unknown.
